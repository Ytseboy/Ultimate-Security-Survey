<h2>About</h2>
<p>Security Survey is an application to make Security Audits for small and middle size companies. 
   In our audits we follow National Security Auditing Criteria guidelines and questions. 
   Our Security Audits vary between 40 and 60 questions.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The students implement the Security Surveys in the companies. 
   Each survey is created by one teacher, implemented and pre-analyzed by a student and validated by a supervising teacher. 
   Supervising teacher selects one student for a survey. 
    The student visits the company, asks the questions and records the answers.</p>

<p>After the company has given all the answers for the survey the student analyzes 
    the questions and adds them to the system. When the student has done the analyses 
    for each question the student creates a Survey report for the company. 
    The supervising teacher validates the report before it is sent for the company.</p>
