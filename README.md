<h4>About</h4>

Security Survey is an application to make Security Audits for small and middle size companies. 
In our audits we follow National Security Auditing Criteria guidelines and questions. 
Our Security Audits vary between 40 and 60 questions.

<h4>How it works</h4>

The students implement the Security Surveys in the companies. Each
survey is created by one teacher, implemented and pre-analyzed by
a student and validated by a supervising teacher. Supervising teacher
selects one student for a survey. The student visits the company, asks
the questions and records the answers.

After the company has given all the answers for the survey the
student analyzes the questions and adds them to the system.
When the student has done the analyses for each question the student
creates a Survey report for the company. The supervising teacher
validates the report before it is sent for the company.
